For example, if the clock loses a second every hour, then we can add a second every hour, in smooth increments, to the value returned to the user. The difficulty is that the clock’s drift rate is liable to be variable – for example, it may be a function of temperature. Therefore we need an adaptive adjustment method, which guesses the drift rate, based on past behaviour, but which compensates when the drift rate is discovered to have changed by the next synchronisation point.\n",

    "If $e$ and $e^\\prime$ are successive events occurring at the same process, or if there is a message $m$ such that $e = send(m)$ and $e^\\prime= rcv(m)$, then the result follows from VC2–VC4. In the latter case the sender includes its timestamp value and the recipient increases its own vector clock entry; all of its other entries remain at least as great as those in the sender’s timestamp. Assume that the result to be proved is true for all pairs of events connected in a sequence of events (in which either HB1 or HB2 applies between each neighbouring pair) of length N or less (N ≥ 2). Now assume that $e$ and $e^\\prime$ are connected in a series of events $e_1, e_2, e_3, .., e_{N+1}$ occurring at one or more processes such that $e = e_1$ and $e^\\prime= e_{N+1}$. Then $e \\rightarrow e_N$ and so $V(e) < V(e_N)$ by the induction hypothesis. But by VC2–VC4, $V(e_N) < V(e^\\prime)$. Therefore $V(e) < V(e^\\prime)$.\n",

    "<b>Ans12.</b><br>\n",
    "Let $e$ and $e^\\prime$ be concurrent and let e occur at $P_i$ and $e^\\prime$ at $P_j$. Because the events are concurrent (not related by happened-before) we know that no message sent from $P_i$ at or after event e has propagated its timestamp to $P_j$ by the time $e^\\prime$ occurs at $P_j$, and vice versa. By the reasoning for Question 11, it follows that $V_j[i] < V_i[i] and V_i[j] < V_j[j]$ (strict inequalities) and therefore that neither $V(e) \\leq V(e^\\prime)$ nor $V(e^\\prime) \\leq V(e)$.\n",
